Research Document: PWA
======================

PWA - Progressive Web Applications would be my choice if you want to scale beyond just programing an NFC tag.

PWA-Why_ Google is pushing PWA, but really it's just pushing AMP next-gen-mobile-first-web-stuff.  In my mind, the key is off-line first, which really is about good cache control.
The PWA-Why_ link will give a good technical marketing pitch that can be used to generate a Mail Services NFC White-Lable Sales Pitch.

PWA-HNPWA-Examples_ is the ToDo-MVC of PWA and a good way to get a demo code and select pattern options.
