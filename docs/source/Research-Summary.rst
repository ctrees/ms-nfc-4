Research Document: Summary
==========================

Conclusion (In order):

#. Do Nothing - Use OS built-in for a basic test of NFC tags (aka no client code).
#. Require Existing App - Integrate into existing User Application (aka use an existing client application).
#. Build NFC feature into our own custom build White-Labled (in order)
    #. PWA-Why_ - Progressive Web App
    #. Dapp-Why_ - Distributed App (aka Blockchain)
    #. HTML5-Why_ based app (but might at well go PWA as that is future of HTML5)
    #. Choose a Framework that builds cross-platform-mobile (no good reason UNLESS above does not work)
    #. Full Custom support of each platform... (self torture)

NFC-4 Request:
An open source research project for nfc client endpoint interaction options.

Client Options:

#. OS Built-ins
    #. Phones with NFC - nfc-phones_
    #. Android NFC - Android-NFC-How-To_
    #. iPhone NFC - iPhone-NFC-Future_
    #. Windows10 - Windows10-NFC-support_
#. Existing User Application
    #. Best NFC apps - TomsGuide-Best-NFC-apps_
#. Custom PWA - :ref:`Research-PWA Document <Research-PWA>` 
    PWA would be my choice if we need to do anything custom on a client.  PWA takes the best parts of HTML5 and is really extending what WebKit effort attempted pre-app-eco-system.
#. HTML5 via W3C-NFC_
    #. Ionic_
    #. PhoneGap_
    #. ApacheCordova_
#. Custom Native Application
    #. Apple-iOS-Swift_
    #. Android-Studio_
    #. Microsoft-UWP_
    #. MS-PowerApps_
