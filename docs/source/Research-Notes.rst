Research Document: ms-nfc-4
===========================

Why is this important?
    Reach - %80 of web traffic is Mobile
    Acquisition - User acquisition costs could be reduced
    Conversion - Conversion (maintain use) aka reduce fragmented endpoint support

"Every step you make a user perform before they get value out of your app will cost you 20% of users"

How do we get started?
    HTTPS - Required
    Ground up Rebuild - Konga.com saw 92% less data (initial load) 82% less data (for first transaction)
    Build Simple - Identify a simple isolated use case (NFC for us)

Specifically, the responsibilities of this reasearch is to:

- Research an endpoint customer user experience interacting with a service nfc programed device.
- Research device and software options of that experience.
- Research methods and tools to support those experiences.
- Research current NFC market use cases.
- Document research findings.
- Create an option matrix with resource estimates.

Microsoft shift from UWP to PWA ?
Windows 10 Redstone 4 will support PWA
Looking at 1.5 million current PWA to put in Windows store

Via Youtube-Twit-WW-556-PWASupport_ Microsoft supports PWA-manifoldjs_
This may be the way Microsoft THINKS it can promote it's store, so SHOULD get traction ?

VisualStudioCode is in electron BUT electron is SUPPER HEAVY Youtube-Twit-WW-556-PWAvsElectron_

create-react-app creates a PWA by default
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app my-pwa
cd my-pwa
npm start
----
vue init
npm install -g vue-cli
vue init pwa my-project
cd my-project
npm install
npm run dev
---
Polymer CLI
---
npmjs.com/package/idb - IndexedDB but with promises
